## Division of Concerns

Polymesh is a unique blockchain technology. As a blockchain, the design differs considerably from server-based architecture. It shares many properties in common with other blockchains but Polymesh accomplishes with ease what can be very challenging to accomplish on general-purpose blockchains.

Developers who are new to distributed ledger technology may find the following comparisons helpful


- A blockchain is similar to a transaction replay log that can, in theory, recreate the system state by replaying the transactions in order. The transaction log is an append-only structure that contain everything that has ever happened in the system.
- Blockchains are stateful protocols, meaning anywhere there is connectivity there is the possibility of inspecting or interacting with the on-chain protocol.  
- Blockchains are deterministic. Logic that would traditionally exist on servers often exists as Smart Contracts. These self-enforcing programs create inviolable rules that can be used to create application-layer solutions. Smart Contracts are usually published by deployment transactions so that their existence is an inarguable fact. Since their functions are determistic there is always only one correct interpretation of effect of any input. 
- Correct operation of the chains is assured by distributed consensus as nodes independently assertain what the result of transaction _must be_ given the preceding state of the chain. Malfunctioning or Byzantine nodes are simply ignored by the rest of the network. Consensus-mechanism logic is a differentiating factor among competiting blockchains, since each presents different performance, finality and fault-tolerance assurances. 
- Every input to a blockchain is a signed transaction so other nodes can be certain that any proposed payload was signed by particulat participant before evaluating what the transaction does at the protocol level and in the context of any Smart Contract logic that might be involved. 

Developers who are new to Polymesh but experienced with other blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethreum or the Hyperledger projects may find the following comparisons helpful

- Polymesh is a public, permissioned network using Nominated Proof-of-Stake. 
- Polymesh is purpose-built for a particular application, not the execution of general-purpose Smart Contracts.
- Polymesh models an industry rather than a Virtual Machine. It's primatives address application-level concerns that other blockchains are agnostic about. For example, asset definition, identity, trade settlement, custody are all defined at the Polymesh network level. Don't worry, there is considerable flexibility built into the system-wide standardized approach. 


## Substrate

In their own words, "Substrate is a modular framework that enables you to create purpose-built blockchains by composing custom or pre-built components." Substrate is the result of years of research into blockchain technology and, more particularly, foundational technology that addresses core concerns. Substrate provides a modular solution for creating a bespoke blockchain using well-solved components for such concerns as consensus, governance, upgrades, and the method of creating protocol rules. 

Polymesh is built on Substrate. As such, Substrate tools are useable for low-level inspection of the chain state. At this level, the transactions appear relatively raw as compared to the Polymesh SDK and Dashboard where data is parsed and presented in more-readable form. 

## Consensus

Polymesh uses a Nominated Proof-of-Stake consensus in which operators create and validate blocks. It is a high-speed protocol as compared to proof-of-work systems. The operators themselves are appointed by network participants who signal support through the on-chain governance process which includes staking POLYX and sharing in network rewards for doing so. 

## Governance

Certain system parameters as well as the operators and system upgrades are controlled by a sophisticated on-chain governance system. In summary, sensitive functions that control the evolution of the network are managed by on-chain decision-making and deterministic execution. The governance system itself can be upgraded via a system upgrade. This is only possible by consensus achieved through the prevailing governance system. The protocol prevents forks, provides an unambiguous description of the current rules and a precise description of the process that must unfold before any change to those rules would be possible. 

## Extensions (Extrinsics)

Polymesh's rules are defined as "extrinsics" which are extensions to the blockchain protocol itself. In other words, there is a similarity to Smart Contracts but extrinsics are implemented at a lower level. Developers can extend Polymesh by creating Substrate extensions. For example, extend an asset with custom logic restricting transfer in a way that is not anticipated by the existing network. 

## Wallet

Blockchain transactions are always signed and a so-called wallet's purpose is to hold signing keys and sign on behalf of the user. Given the flexibility of public/private key encryption, there are always multiple ways to sign a transaction - some are more human-friendly and some are more machine-friendly. The Polymesh Wallet is a human-friendly browser extension that hold secret signing keys and signs transactions for a human user. 

## Dashboard

The Polymesh Dashboard is multi-faceted GUI that is in many ways like a blockchain explorer. Again, we see the advantage of a purpose-built chain as compared to a generalized chain. The Polymesh Dashboard knows precisely what the application is about and effortlessly interprets every transaction. Many activities that would require specialized application-layer user-interfaces are seemlessly integrated into this unified GUI. The interface is built using the SDK which gives developers a hint of what is possible using the SDK. 

## SDK

The SDK is a JavaScript or Typescript (developer's choice) set of methods that expose the entire Polymesh API. The SDK wraps blockchain concerns in a way that will be familiar to developers of non-blockchain applications. It is expected that most Service Providers will integrate their legacy systems and Polymesh using the SDK.

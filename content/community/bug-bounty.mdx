### Overview
Welcome to the Polymath Bug Bounty Program.
Polymesh is the software that powers the nodes of the Polymath blockchain. We want Polymesh to be robust and be the best it can be. This is where we need your help, to assist us in finding bugs and vulnerabilities. Confirmed bugs or vulnerabilities will get monetary rewards (bounty). Please see our Rules & Rewards section for more details.


To get started, Read the [Rules](/community/bug-bounty-rules) and the [Developer Documentation](/quickstart/), to learn about how to setup Polymesh and how to approach the bug bounty program.

Having some prior knowledge about capital markets and Rust language can be beneficial. If you have still have any questions, reach out to us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ud2deWAnyt), or email us at [bugbounty@polymath.network](mailto:bugbounty@polymath.network).

You can also submit the bug reports on our Bug Bounty program on Immunefi.  

### Bounty Scope
The bug bounty will be applicable for the following repositories, sources and sites:

* [https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/Polymesh/releases/tag/v3.0.0](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/Polymesh/releases/tag/v3.0.0)
* [https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/cryptography/tree/da06e1db8b6d907dd81bd63c5f26e18c77836081/confidential-identity](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/cryptography/tree/da06e1db8b6d907dd81bd63c5f26e18c77836081/confidential-identity)
 

Following are ***out of scope***:

* [https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/Polymesh/tree/develop/pallets/contracts](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/Polymesh/tree/develop/pallets/contracts)
* [https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/Polymesh/tree/develop/contracts](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/Polymesh/tree/develop/contracts)
* No “test” code - i.e. javascript integration tests or unit tests are in scope.

### Rules

* Rewards will be decided on a per case basis. This bug bounty program’s terms and conditions are at the sole discretion of Polymath Network.
* Rewards will vary depending on the severity of the issue.
* Disclose the bug only on the platforms approved by us (Federacy/Immunefi). Do not disclose a bug or vulnerability anywhere else to the public. Doing such would disqualify it from being considered for a reward.
* The bugs being considered for the reward are based on first come first serve basis, duplicate bugs will not be considered.
* If you want to add more information to a provided issue, edit the original report, do not create a new submission.
* Other variables considered for rewards include: the quality of the issue description, the instructions for reproducibility, and the quality of the fix (if included).
* Determinations of eligibility, score and all terms related to an award are at the sole and final discretion of Polymath Network.
* Submissions needs to be related with the Bounty Scope. Submissions out of the Bounty Scope won’t be eligible for a reward.
* Any interference with the protocol, client or platform services, on purpose or not during the process will make the submission process invalid.
* It is mandatory to read and follow the responsible disclosure policy available in the references. Submissions not following the disclosure policy will not be eligible for a reward.
* By participating in the Polymath Bug Bounty program, you agree to abide by the [terms and condition](/community/bug-bounty-rules) of the program.

We may modify the terms or terminate this program at any time.
 

### Vulnerability Classification and Rewards

|-|-|-|
| CRITICAL<br/>(CVSS 9.0 - 10.0) | Transaction manipulation /censorship, double-spending,<br/> POLY/POLYX minting, unauthorized token minting, staled <br/>or undermined consensus/network, governance <br/>censorship or compromise, manipulation of signing <br/>keys or master keys to gain unauthorised access to <br/>an identity. | USD 3000 - 5000 |
| HIGH<br/>(CVSS 7.0 - 8.9) | Ability to use an extrinsic panic unexpectedly <br/>without proper handling, block the on-chain governance <br/>system from it's expected behaviour, block other users<br/>from their ability to perform expected tasks (griefing). | USD 1000 - 3000 |
| MEDIUM<br/>(CVSS 4.0 - 6.9) | Ability to put chain data into an unexpected state which <br/>otherwise doesn't cause any disruption, forcing the <br/>emission of events which are incorrect. | USD 250 - 750 |
| LOW<br/>(CVSS 00 - 3.9) | DoS'ing of the operator nodes, incorrect data being <br/>logged through events. | USD 100 - 300 |

### Exclusions
While researching, please refrain from:

* Denial of service in general and of Public RPC nodes
* Attacks that consume a substantial amount of Kovan ETH, Kovan POLY or Testnet POLYX and which would otherwise be cost-prohibitive on mainnet
* Spamming
* Social engineering (including phishing) of Polymath staff
* Any physical attempts against Polymath property or data centres

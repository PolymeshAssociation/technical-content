Learn how assets (regulated security tokens) are designed and created in Polymesh.

We will use an example scenario to illustrate how this works.

What’s inside?
* An overview explaining the main concepts.
* An introductory exercise with a step-by-step process you can follow.
* A developer-level exercise diving deep into SDK methods you can use to integrate Polymesh into existing processes and systems.
* A self-assessment quiz to evaluate how far we have come.
* Links to reference documentation to help advanced users find in-depth resources.
